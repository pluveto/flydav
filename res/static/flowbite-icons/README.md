## Getting started

The quickest way of you can start using these icons is by going to the [Flowbite Icons](https://flowbite.com/icons/) page and copy-paste the icons as raw SVG or JSX (React) by selecting the "copy as" option. You can also configure the icon size and stroke width via our custom interface.

</a>

## Basic usage

The default examples are provided with raw SVG code source which is a flexible and efficient way of integrating icons into your web application regardless of what tech stack you're using.

Here is a solid and outline version of the same `notification-bell` icon:

```html
<!-- Notification bell solid -->
<svg class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-white" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 14 20">
    <path d="M12.133 10.632v-1.8A5.406 5.406 0 0 0 7.979 3.57.946.946 0 0 0 8 3.464V1.1a1 1 0 0 0-2 0v2.364a.946.946 0 0 0 .021.106 5.406 5.406 0 0 0-4.154 5.262v1.8C1.867 13.018 0 13.614 0 14.807 0 15.4 0 16 .538 16h12.924C14 16 14 15.4 14 14.807c0-1.193-1.867-1.789-1.867-4.175ZM3.823 17a3.453 3.453 0 0 0 6.354 0H3.823Z"/>
</svg>

<!-- Notification bell outline -->
<svg class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-white" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 16 21">
    <path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M8 3.464V1.1m0 2.365a5.338 5.338 0 0 1 5.133 5.368v1.8c0 2.386 1.867 2.982 1.867 4.175C15 15.4 15 16 14.462 16H1.538C1 16 1 15.4 1 14.807c0-1.193 1.867-1.789 1.867-4.175v-1.8A5.338 5.338 0 0 1 8 3.464ZM4.54 16a3.48 3.48 0 0 0 6.92 0H4.54Z"/>
</svg>
```

You can copy and paste this into your project and you can set the color via `text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400` and the size with the Tailwind CSS `w-{*}` width and `h-{*}` classes.

## JSX format (React)

To start using the icons inside a React or Next.js project you will need to update the attributes to use camelCase format and exchange `class` with `className`:

```jsx
// Notification bell solid JSX
<svg className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-white" ariaHidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 14 20">
    <path d="M12.133 10.632v-1.8A5.406 5.406 0 0 0 7.979 3.57.946.946 0 0 0 8 3.464V1.1a1 1 0 0 0-2 0v2.364a.946.946 0 0 0 .021.106 5.406 5.406 0 0 0-4.154 5.262v1.8C1.867 13.018 0 13.614 0 14.807 0 15.4 0 16 .538 16h12.924C14 16 14 15.4 14 14.807c0-1.193-1.867-1.789-1.867-4.175ZM3.823 17a3.453 3.453 0 0 0 6.354 0H3.823Z"/>
</svg>

// Notification bell outline JSX
<svg className="w-6 h-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-white" ariaHidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 16 21">
    <path stroke="currentColor" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth="2" d="M8 3.464V1.1m0 2.365a5.338 5.338 0 0 1 5.133 5.368v1.8c0 2.386 1.867 2.982 1.867 4.175C15 15.4 15 16 14.462 16H1.538C1 16 1 15.4 1 14.807c0-1.193 1.867-1.789 1.867-4.175v-1.8A5.338 5.338 0 0 1 8 3.464ZM4.54 16a3.48 3.48 0 0 0 6.92 0H4.54Z"/>
</svg>
```

You can use our custom interface on [Flowbite Icons](https://flowbite.com/icons/) to select if you want the raw SVG or JSX (React) format and these changes will be applied automatically.

## Svelte

Thanks to the open-source community from Svelte - the Flowbite Icons collection is now also available to be used in Svelte projects by installing the official [Svelte icons package](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte-icons) built by [shinokada](https://github.com/shinokada).

```sh
npm i -D flowbite-svelte-icons
```

Import the icons from the freshly installed package:

```html
<script>
  import { AddressCardSolid } from 'flowbite-svelte-icons';
</script>

<AddressCardSolid />
```

Learn more about usage by going to the [Flowbite Svelte Icons](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte-icons) repository on GitHub.

## Laravel & Blade support

Thanks to the open-source community you can now also install and use the Flowbite Icons collection inside a Laravel project as Blade components based on the [Flowbite Blade Icons](https://github.com/ncoo-dev/blade-flowbite-icons) repository built by [Dominique Thomas](https://github.com/domthomas-dev).

## Installation

```bash
composer require ncoo-dev/blade-flowbite-icons
```

## Updating

Please refer to [`the upgrade guide`](UPGRADE.md) when updating the library.

## Blade Icons

Blade Flowbite Icons uses Blade Icons under the hood. Please refer to [the Blade Icons readme](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) for additional functionality. We also recommend to [enable icon caching](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#caching) with this library.

## Configuration

Blade Flowbite Icons also offers the ability to use features from Blade Icons like default classes, default attributes, etc. If you'd like to configure these, publish the `blade-flowbite-icons.php` config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-flowbite-icons-config
```

## Usage

Icons can be used as self-closing Blade components which will be compiled to SVG icons:

```blade
<x-fbi-outline.general.adjustments-horizontal/>
```

You can also pass classes to your icon components:

```blade
<x-fbi-outline.general.adjustments-horizontal class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500"/>
```

And even use inline styles:

```blade
<x-fbi-outline.general.adjustments-horizontal style="color: #555"/>
```

The solid icons can be referenced like this:

```blade
<x-fbi-solid.general.adjustments-horizontal/>
```
